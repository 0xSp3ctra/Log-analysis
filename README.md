# log-analysis
This project is a set of codes that allows you to read and analyze a log file, to then create statistics in different views.
The initial idea is to break down and analyze a connection log file from a site at the University of VÃ©lizy. Then, I wrote scripts in order to recover the interesting parts of this log file then to put them in the form of text, graphic and HTML.
